AS7050 Software Support Package
###############################

The Software Support Package for AS7050 sensor solutions provides
software components, examples and documentations to enable users
to quickly prototype their own solutions.

Following software components are provided:
* Chip Library: Configures and controls the AS7050 sensor and
  delivers the output data from the sensor
* Application Manager: Configures and controls the included Vital Signs
  Applications for heart rate monitoring, SpO2 monitoring, and GSR measurement.
* Sample Code: Demonstrates the usage of the Chip Library and the
  Application Manager
* Linux Driver: Sample device driver to control the AS7050 sensor
  on Linux platforms using the Chip Library


How to start
============

Follow the instructions of the 'AS7050 Software Support Package User Guide'
(doc/AS7050_Software_Support_Package-User_Guide-v1.3.pdf).
